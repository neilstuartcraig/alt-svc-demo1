                This demo page has an Alt-Svc HTTP response header which will offer the secondary as an alternative. If you're using a recent Firefox, you should notice that at least some of the page assets are loaded from the secondary and also that either immediately or after a small delay, the poller output below will reflect that it too has switch to the secondary.
